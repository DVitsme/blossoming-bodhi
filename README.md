# My To Do List

## My skipped Over List

* Admin sidebar
  * Problem: I set the width to be 1/6th so on small devices the text gets squished and you cant read it. 
  * Solution: 
    * Create a breakpoint that makes the (text + users name disappear) and the (icon + user img) will take its place
    * Needs smaller icon on the bottom so when the user clicks it the sidebar will expand to a larger size(mabye 2/6) so that the end user can be displayed the corresponding Title incase they do not know what each icon represents.
